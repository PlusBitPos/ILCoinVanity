# **ILCoinVanity**

If you're tired of the random, cryptic addresses generated by regular ILCoin clients, then ILCoinVanity is the right choice for you to create a more personalized address. ILCoinVanity is a command-line vanity ILCoin address generator. Add unique flair when you tell people to send ILC. 

ILCoinVanity's search is probabilistic, and the amount of time required to find a given pattern depends on how complex the pattern is, the speed of your computer, and whether you get lucky. Itâ€™s possible to generate every word with a few exceptions, but the number of the selected letters is limited. 3-4-digit combination is recommended. For example, the prefix 1BaTMiN would take 2 months for 50% chance.

ILCoinVanity includes components to perform address searching on your CPU. It can be built from source, and it is included in the Windows binary package.

Upon finding a match for a given pattern, ILCoinVanity will stop searching for additional matches for that pattern. To search for multiple matches for each pattern, use the -k option.

To use ILCoinVanity, you need to open a command line window and change to the directory where you extracted the ILCoinVanityprogram.  An easy way to do this in Windows 7, hold down the shift key, right-click on the folder where you unzipped vanitygen, and select "Open command window here."  Then, you can type the ILCoinVanity command at the prompt. Example how to use:
